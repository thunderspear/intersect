               Navigating new technologies in a rapidly advancing field does not need to be frustrating. Traditional lower limb techniques often create problems when combined with upper limb technology. I've spent more than half of my <!--27 year--> CPO career specializing in issues unique to upper limb prothetics. In this time, I have developed expertise in reducing upper limb prosthesis rejection rates, navigating difficult coding for upper limb loss, and educating teams on the unique and often subtle differences between solving upper and lower limb problems. Let me help you build the confidence you need to provide the best possible care to your patients.

He is gifted at breaking down work structures so nothing is missed. He is an extremely preventative person as opposed to reactive. Karl is also quite patient and can instruct or demonstrate any prosthetic subject to any audience - whether a busy physician or a traumatically brain injured patient. I highly recommend Karl, for his efficiency as well as his compassion."
