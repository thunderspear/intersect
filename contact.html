                  <p>Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food. OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms.</p>
                  <p>Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". Oh yeah, good luck with that. Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually!</p>

                     I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet.</p>
