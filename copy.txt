Image of Karl: Navigating new technologies in a rapidly advancing field does not need to be frustrating. Traditional lower limb techniques often create problems when combined with upper limb technology. I've spent the more recent half of my 27 year CPO career specializing in issues unique to upper limb prothetics. In this time, I have developed expertise in reducing upper limb prosthesis rejection rates, navigating difficult coding for upper limb loss, and educating teams on the unique and often subtle differences between solving upper and lower limb problems. Let me help you build the confidence you need to provide the best possible care to your patients.

Testimonials:

Susie P. Faker: THIS TESTIMONIAL IS LOREM IPSUM "Karl showed me how to avoid certain dangerous assumptions during the evaluation phase of occupational therapy cases. His professionalism, combined with improvements to my existing processes saved me and my patients a lot of frustration."

Joaquin Z. Genuine: THIS TESTIMONIAL IS LOREM IPSUM "Our practice was devastated after repeatably misapplying Forstner's Seven Principles of Lower Limb Diagnostics to a patient's transhumeral UL amputation. Karl showed us how to produce Memorandums of Understanding that allowed us to connect with UL patient needs and reduced our financial risk."

Erin Donaldson, MA, MS
Instructional Design and eLearning Development Specialist
I am thankful to have had the opportunity to collaborate with Karl on both clinical education projects, as well as patient care. He is gifted at breaking down work structures so nothing is missed. He is an extremely preventative person as opposed to reactive. Karl is also quite patient and can instruct or demonstrate any prosthetic subject to any audience - whether a busy physician or a traumatically brain injured patient. I highly recommend Karl, for his efficiency as well as his compassion.

Services offered:
Classes, Technical Upper Limb, 
Consultation

    Prosthetic and orthotic technology is rapidly advancing. Most clinicians have minimal 
    exposure to upper limb prosthetics. While they are proficient in lower limb prosthetics, 
    we have seen that lower limb techniques applied to upper limb technology can create 
    problems. For clinicians presented with an upper limb case, consultation with a trusted 
    specialist can make the difference between success and failure of the device, and adoption 
    or rejection by the client. Intersect OPS offers expertise with upper limb external or 
    body powered prostheses, myoelectric control, control site selection, socket interface 
    design, beginning ADL training, trouble shooting, and more. 

Educate

    Whether on an individual basis or in a group setting, Intesect OPS provides training and education based on experience. Topics include traditional and advanced O&P technology, alternative solutions, clinical justification, fabrication techniques, and more.
